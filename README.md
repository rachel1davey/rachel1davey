# Hey, I'm Rachel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student learning how to build cool things with code.
Right now, I'm focused on getting better at what I'm learning.

This GitHub is where I keep my projects, experiments, and WIP stuff as I figure things out.

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Learning

- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Python and Flask
- Electron for simple desktop apps
- How to write code that actually makes sense

## ðŸ§ª Projects in Progress

- **Lo-Fi Pomodoro** â€“ a calming timer app with relaxing music, built in Electron
- **Flask Meme Page** â€“ a simple web app made with Python + Flask

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I'm Doing This

I'm not trying to make anything perfect right now, just learning by building. 
Every project teaches me something new, even if it breaks every second.. ðŸ˜‚

If you're also learning, feel free to connect or check out my stuff! :)
